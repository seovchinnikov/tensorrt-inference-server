/// ConcurrencyManager is a helper class to send inference requests to inference
/// server consistently, based on the specified setting, so that the perf_client
/// can measure performance under different concurrency.
///
/// An instance of concurrency manager will be created at the beginning of the
/// perf client and it will be used to simulate different load level in respect
/// to number of concurrent infer requests and to collect per-request statistic.
///
/// Detail:
/// Concurrency Manager will maintain the number of concurrent requests by
/// spawning worker threads that keep sending randomly generated requests to the
/// server. The worker threads will record the start time and end
/// time of each request into a shared vector.
///
